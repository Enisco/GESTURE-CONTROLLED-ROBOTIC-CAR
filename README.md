# GESTURE-CONTROLLED-ROBOTIC-CAR
The robotic car is controlled with a wireless, robotic hand glove that responds to gestures and sends corresponding instructions to the car.
 there are two codes involves: one is for the car itself, the other is for the robotic glove for controlling the car. 
 Note that some thirdparty arduino libraries are used, and they have to be installed into your arduino libraries before the codes can compile.
